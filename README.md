**The structure of SAR and OPT our data are as follows:

SAR has 4 bands in all. The first 2 bands are VV, VH of time 1, and the later 2 bands are VV, VH of time 2.

OPT has 14 bands in all. The first 7 bands are B2,B3,B4,B8,B8A,B11,B12 of time 1, and the later 7 bands are B2,B3,B4,B8,B8A,B11,B12 of time 2.


**We will soon open our code and datasets with selected features
